    <h1>RUNAWAY </h1>
   
    <div id="textwrap1"><p>
      This is a runaway bride.

      She does not know where she is running, only that she must. Her gown, once white, is torn at the hem, stained with earth and time. The veil clings to her hair like a desperate ghost. Her breath is shallow, her hands tremble, but she does not stop.
      
      She cannot stop.
      
      There is a house. An American cottage, wooden and warm, with windows that glow in the dusk. Inside, there is a family—voices muffled, laughter distant. Their faces are smooth, blank like unfinished dolls. They do not call her by name. They call her bride.
      
      She is not their bride.
      
      She is running from something. Something unknown, something horrific. Something with fingers too long, shadows that stretch in the wrong direction. It whispers through the walls at night, curling around her in bed, murmuring secrets she does not understand. She does not remember the ceremony. She does not remember saying yes.
      
      And yet, the ring is on her finger.
    </p></div>
    <div id="textwrap2"><p>
      <h2>Guide to Escape:</h2>
      <li class="textwrap2list">Destroy the Dress. The dress belongs to the past, to the ceremony, to the thing that waits in the dark. Rip it, burn it, bury it beneath the roots of an old tree. If it remains whole, she remains tethered.

      </li>
    <li class="textwrap2list">Avoid the Mirrors. The mirrors whisper. The reflection is not her own. It smiles when she does not. Do not look. Do not listen.

    </li>
    <li class="textwrap2list">Do Not Acknowledge the Family. They are not her family. They are placeholders, shadows stitched into the shape of comfort. They speak in riddles, and when she turns away, their mouths do not close. Do not eat their food. Do not let them hold her hands. Do not sleep where they can watch.

    </li>
    <li class="textwrap2list">Follow the Cracks in Reality. The world is not right. The door at the end of the hall was not there yesterday. The trees outside shift when she is not looking. There are roads that do not exist on maps. She must take them, no matter where they lead.

    </li>
    <li class="textwrap2list">Forget the Groom. There was a man once, or something wearing the skin of a man. She cannot remember his face. She cannot remember his voice. But the thought of him twists her stomach into knots. He is calling to her. He is waiting at the end of the aisle, grinning.</li>
    <li class="textwrap2list">Run. Always Run. The moment she stops, it will catch her. The ceremony will resume. The vows will be spoken. The veil will lower. And once the kiss is given, there is no running left.

   <div id="textwrap3"> <p>
      She does not know how long she has been running. Time bends. Clocks tick backward. The air tastes of rain, of dirt, of something old and rotting beneath her feet. But she does not stop.

      Because she knows—deep in the marrow of her bones, in the trembling of her fingers, in the echo of her heartbeat—
      
      If she stops, she will never be the bride again.
      
      She will be something else.
      
      And that is far, far worse.
